<p>Welcome to the Milpitas High School Server Launcher!</p>
<p>This launcher has some little secrets inside, which help protect the server from cheaters. Since, the server is modded this also launches the modpack the server is going to be running. Adding mods allows for far more content and overall will be more for you, as the player. Since most people don't know how to install mods, we made this launcher to make it available for anybody.</p>
<p>This launcher is quite robust right now, so please hang on as we start to make it look a tad bit more beautiful.</p>
<p>If you ever have any problems, feel free to contact our team!</p>
